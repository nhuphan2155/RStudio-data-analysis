Project name: Chlorophyll-a index is affected by the presence of Trichodesmium at Great Barrier Reef

The aim is to find out if there is change in chlorophyll-a level during the presence of Trichodesmium blooms, resulting in changing water quality in the ocean at Great Barrier Reef.

Used R Studio with tidyverse library to perform Initial Data Analysis and cleaning.

Used visualisations to check normality and equal variance assumptions. Transformed data and perform the check again.

Performed hypothesis testing on transformed data to calculate the significance of key results on samples and conclusions.
